Welcome to my Snake Game.

2 years ago I followed a Youtube video on how to program a Snake Game in java.
Watching through the video originally wasn't fulfilling for me.
I didn't want to essentially copy everything from a YouTube video without knowing what anything means.
After this experience I told myself I would program a Snake Game on my own accord when I got better at Java.
This small project is just that. A sloppy mess written in a few hours which showed myself that I could do it.

This project isn't a proper demonstration of my skills as a Java developer; it wasn't meant to be.
I simply wanted to prove to myself that I could finally do it.

Thanks for reading!
